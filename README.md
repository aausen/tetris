# Tetris

View the live website [here.](https://aausen.github.io/tetris/)

My take on the classic arcade game where players try to skillfully stack tetrominos to create lines across
the grid. Make a full line and gain points. If you reach 150 points, you win! Stack the tetrominos to the top 
and game over.
